# Query-on-a-Physical-Database
A MySQL script file was provided when run, will create a database called “human_resources”. Once database is created, further more queries are created within MySQL that answer the following business questions.

2. FROM clause: This specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve the data.
3. WHERE clause: This is used to specify conditions that the data must meet in order to be retrieved. For example, it might specify that only records with a certain value in a particular column should be returned.
4. JOIN clause: This is used to combine data from multiple tables based on a common column.
5. GROUP BY clause: This is used to group the results by a particular column.
6. ORDER BY clause: This is used to sort the results by a particular column.
7. LIMIT clause: This is used to limit the number of results returned.
8. INSERT statement: This is used to insert new data into the database.
9. UPDATE statement: This is used to modify existing data in the database.
